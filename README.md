If you're building a waterslide, focus first on building a ladder up to the top of the slide,  connecting straight pieces of the slide down, and some water at the bottom to land in. The very minimum that you need to do be able to successfully send something through the slide.

Add in the sick loop-da-loops, wild slide curves, platform up top for a queue, and special pool jets for the landing later.
